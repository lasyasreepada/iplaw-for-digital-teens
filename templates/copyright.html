      <div class="text">
	      <p>Copyright is a legal right over the use and distribution of an original work granted to its creator, usually for a limited time. These exclusive rights are not absolute and are governed by Title 17 of the US Code (USC 17), which outlines fundamentals of copyright law and its exceptions, including fair use. Copyrightable works must be original expressions of an idea that are not functional products. </p>
	      <p>Copyright covers literary, musical, dramatic, choreographic, pictorial, sculptural, sound, architectural, and audiovisual works. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation, but it does protect the way these things are expressed. A work is copyrighted as soon as it is fixed in a tangible form. Both unpublished and published works are protected. Having a copyright to a work allows the author to control how that work is used and distributed.</p>
	      <p>Copyright infringement is unauthorized use of a copyrighted work. The protection against copyright infringement is fair use. This doctrine allows excerpts of copyrighted material to be used without permission or payment to the copyright holder. When deciding whether the use of a copyrighted work can be considered fair use, courts follow four factors: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount of copyrighted work used, and the effect of the use upon the copyrighted work’s market. The purpose and character of the use refers to how transformative the use is. For example, a parody of a video transforms the original video by offering criticism. The nature of the copyrighted work refers to whether the work is fictional and/or published. Usually, it is easier to claim fair use for copying facts rather than fictional works. Additionally, the scope of fair use is narrower for unpublished works since an author has the right to control the first public appearance of their work. The amount of copyrighted work used refers to how much copying has been done. The less that is copied, the better. Lastly, the effect of the use upon the copyrighted work’s market refers to the impact that the “new” work on the original. Usually, undermining the original work and harming the income the author receives from it is likely to negatively impact a fair use claim. </p>
	      <p>Copyright is different from trademarks and patents. Copyright protects original works created by artists. Patents typically protect discoveries/inventions, and trademarks protect a company’s brand. Read more about <a href="patent">patents</a> and <a href="trademark">trademarks</a> here.
