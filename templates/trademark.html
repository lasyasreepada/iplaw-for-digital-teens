	      <h4 class="text">by Lauren Ribordy</h4>
	      <p><b>Trademarks: What They Protect and Why</b></p>
	      <p>The principal purpose of trademark is to protect consumers. Trademarks do this by assuring consumers that branded goods are genuine--a brand name will correlate with the product's origin.</p>
	      <p>For instance, if you go to the grocery store and want to buy Crest toothpaste, you can be sure that the toothpaste with the Crest logo on it is genuinely Crest toothpaste. It will be the same toothpaste you have purchased before, the same toothpaste available in stores all across America.</p>
	      <p>If trademark law didn't exist, anybody could set up shop and sell their own "Crest" labeled toothpaste. Surely, at the supermarket, you would be able to find genuine Crest toothpaste. However, you would spend considerable more time sorting through all the fake toothpastes before finding your desired product. Moreover, you might still make a mistake and purchase a knock-off. Every trip to the supermarket would be a wild rodeo to chase down the items you really want--and avoid the fakes you don't.</p>
	      <p>Who wins out in the scenario above? Producers. The companies who profit from people accidentally buying their goods instead of the real thing would profit immensely from a world free of trademark protections. This profit comes at the cost of consumers, who must spend inordinately more time ensuring product validity and risk of buying undesired goods.</p>
	      <p>All brands have trademark protection, whether they officially file for it with the federal or state government or not. For instance, if you start your own business selling toothpaste, and have a slogan and a symbol to represent your brand that people in your area will be able to relate back to your product, you have a valid trademark on said slogan and insignia. However, if your slogan and insignia are too vague, such that people hearing the slogan or seeing the insignia wouldn't uniquely associate one or the other with your product, you have no trademark.</p>
	      <p>Why is this the case? To reiterate, trademarks exist to help consumers verify the origin and validity of a product. If your product is labeled such that consumers would be unable to associate it with your business, then you have fundamentally failed in creating a trademark.</p>
	      <p>What things can be trademarked? An incredibly broad range of things can be trademarked. In theory, anything that could reliably serve as identification of brand could serve as trademark. For instance, a perfume's signature smell could be trademarked (though looking up this trademark in the USTPO would be challenging!). A sound can be trademarked, such as the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/soundmarks/75332744.mp3" target="_blank">Intel's four-note sequence.</a></p>
	      <p>With regards to court cases, many trademark cases arise over companies using a symbol already trademarked by another company. One example of this is the case Chemical Corp. of America v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc. Bud Light--Anheuser-Busch--invested a significant amount of capital into advertising its brand by way of catchy slogan: "Where there's life, there's Bud." After the slogan had already become well-known, Chemical Corp. of America developed its own similar slogan, "Where there's life, there's bugs." This case is an example of unfair competition, whereby one competitor seeks to piggy-back off the success of another for easy profit.</p>
	      <p>Another example is the case Christian Louboutin v. Yves Saint Laurent. Louboutin developed a signature for his brand: putting red lacquered soles on shoes. He filed for an official federal trademark on his red soles and received notice that the trademark had been approved. When Yves Saint Laurent made a shoe that was completely red--soles included--Louboutin argued that Yves Saint Laurent had infringed on his trademark.</p>
	      <p>A final interesting example is Mattel Inc. v. MCA Records. For some background, Mattel is the owner of the popular toy doll Barbie. Barbie, the doll, is trademarked. When the band Aqua produced the famous song, Barbie Girl, Mattel sued on grounds that when people thought of Barbie, no longer did they only think of the doll, but also of the song. At first glance, this may not seem to be an issue; no consumers are going to confuse the doll with the song when they go shopping, nor are they likely to assume that Mattel sponsored the song's creation. However, trademark also serves an almost contrary, secondary role: to protect large corporations' marks.</p>
	      <p>Mattel, a large corporation, produced evidence in the above case detailing how the Barbie Girl song caused it to sustain monetary injuries by diluting its Barbie mark. Dilution is eloquently defined as <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/889/1018/354390/" target="_blank">whittling away of the value of a trademark"</a> when the same mark is used for other goods, such as the Barbie doll trandemark used to identify Aqua's song. One of two express purposes of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act is to protect corporations from entities, such as American Chemical Company in the first court case example above, from profiting off their well-established mark (referred to as "blurring" the mark). If Barbie Girl were presumptively about another, lesser-known doll, the song reasonably could have never realized the same level of success it eventually did. The second express purpose is to protect a corporation's trademark from tarnishment; in reality, a plaintiff will only win with this argument if the defendant has tarnished their mark by incoporating said mark into a work in an explicit/sexual way, such as in the case Dallas Cheerleaders v. Pussycat Cinema where pornstars impersonate Dallas Cheerleaders.</p>
	      <p>Clearly, trademark law is multifaceted and incredibly useful to anyone in America with their own product and brand name.
