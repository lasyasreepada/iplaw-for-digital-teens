Final Project for CPSC 184: Intellectual Property in the Digital Age. Sp '17

This is a simple web application built with Python Flask. It was designed to be the go-to site for informative and humorous content related with cases from Intellectual Property Law. Browse through the sections on Copyright, Trademarks, and Patents to get an understanding of the main branches of IP Law. Head over to the Memes tab for glorious square cartoons poking fun at some of the most ridiculous cases in the field. There's even a Buzzfeed-style quiz to help you decide what kind of IP Law is For You! We hope this endeavor will get people hyped about IP :)
